# April 15, 2020 Q/A for Dele

- Strong Preference for a MERN app
- Customer is the Doctor/Clinic, but main user is the Patient
- Prioritize quick check-in, keep the steps as little as possible
  - Ask for Address/Age and deduce the rest using EMR API
- Primary use of the app is for check-in
  - Not for booking!
  - Assume this is not a first time user (i.e. they already exist in the EMR database)
- 2 types of admin
  - Clinic admin
    - Dashboard for medical office assistant (MOA)
    - Administer, facilitate
    - If a patient doesn't show up, the clinic should be able to mark the appointment as missed or remove it from the schedule
    - Should be able to view appointments
  - Company admin
    - Complete access to clinic admin
    - Reset passwords
    - Change users, roles
    - No deletion support, opt to disable/enable
    - Suspend clinic accounts
    - Upgrade clinic accounts to additional features
      - Support for registration, modifying appointments is extra
      - Eg. if a clinic is at capacity, the clinic will want to disable the registration feature
    - API documentation
- There should be three separate UI/portals - patient, clinic, and admin
