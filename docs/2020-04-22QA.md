# April 21, 2020 Q/A for Dele

- EMR will host all of the domain info

  - Patients
  - Appointment schedule
  - Doctors
  - Clinics

- The check in app will keep track of the actual time patients checked in, as well as details relating specifically to their check in.

- Generally speaking our application will not write back to the EMR system

- Check in is only for the current day

  - Our app should fetch and cache all appointments for the current day
  - After the appointments are loaded, the app should not need the EMR system in order to function

- Check in should be dynamic based on clinic preferences

  - The clinic can decide what info is required for a patient to check in
  - Additional details can be requested after the patient has checked in
