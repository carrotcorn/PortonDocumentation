# Fuzziness

- User management
  - How are users created? Where/how are users registered
  - How do you setup roles?
  - How do you log in?

# User features

- Porton Admin

  - View list of clinic accounts
  - Ability to enable/disable account (revoke auth/key)
    - Maintain a blacklist on the server of keys which are disabled and check on each request

- Clinic Admin

  - View appointments/status (realtime?)
  - Configure check-in form
  - Nice to have
    - List of kiosks
    - Logout/disable kiosk

# User Flows

## Admin Flow

- Login Screen
- The admin view will vary depending on the user's role
  - Clinic admin will see the check-in configuration and appointments
  - Porton admin will see a list of accounts
- Logout can be accessed from the nav

## Kiosk Flow

- Clinic admin logs into the kiosk application using the same credentials they would use on the admin site
- The kiosk app uses the clinic's id/credentials to access relevant appointments
- Login should not expire (there cannot be a logout option on the patient end)
  - Logout from the admin side
  - Clinic can set logout expiry time
- Setup complete, welcome screen displayed and ready for patients

# Tasks

- Seeding dummy data into db

  - Use a script or configure a mongo atlas instance

- Dockerize backend

- View list of clinic accounts

  - Page with list of clinics
  - Slider on each row to enable/disable account

- Enable/disable a clinic accounts on the backend

  - Admin endpoint for adding/removing accounts from blacklist (alternatively, store the account status on the clinic itself depending on auth implementation)

- View appointments/status

  - Status should reflect patient check in
    - Basic implementation would load the appointment info when the component mounts
    - Future implementation can be realtime with websockets

- Configure check-in form
  - Store config for each user in the db
  - Form validation/submission needs to be implemented on the backend
